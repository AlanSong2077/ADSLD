# ADSLD: A General Framework for Solving Large-Scale Linear Programming Problems in Multi-Order Fulfillment Scenarios

Welcome to the **ADSLD** repository! This project introduces a groundbreaking framework for efficiently solving large-scale linear programming problems in multi-order fulfillment scenarios, leveraging **Lagrangian Relaxation**, **duality principles**, and **arbitrary decomposition**.

---

## üìò **Overview**

This repository provides an implementation of the **Arbitrary Decomposition Supergradient Method Based on Lagrangian Relaxation and Duality (ADSLD)**. The rapid growth of e-commerce has led to unprecedented challenges in handling millions of orders daily and managing fulfillment for a diverse range of products. ADSLD addresses these challenges by:

- Decomposing complex problems into manageable subproblems.
- Balancing computational resource utilization.
- Extending scalability and efficiency.

This framework generalizes existing methods, such as the Completely Decomposed Supergradient Method (CDSLD), to accommodate arbitrary decomposition strategies, enabling enhanced performance and adaptability in various fulfillment scenarios.

## üöÄ **Algorithm Features**

- **Lagrangian Relaxation**  
  Converts complex constraints into manageable subproblems using Lagrangian multipliers.  

- **Duality Principles**  
  Applies dual optimization techniques to achieve computational efficiency.

- **Arbitrary Decomposition**  
  Allows flexible decomposition strategies, balancing time and space complexities.

## üîß **Code Description**

The implementation consists of four key components:

1. **Random Data Initialization**  
   - Simulates a multi-order fulfillment environment.  
   - Handles scenarios with tens of millions of variables.  

2. **Lagrangian Relaxation Problem Definition & Solution**  
   - Configures the **CPLEX solver** and **Pulp** for mathematical modeling.  
   - Supports distributed computing for large-scale problems.  

3. **Lagrangian Multiplier Updates (Supergradient Method)**  
   - Trades space for time to derive approximate solutions.  
   - Refines solutions through multiple iterations.  

4. **Performance Evaluation**  
   - Evaluates scalability and accuracy of solutions.

## üìä **Theoretical Insights**

### **Optimization Model**
The ADSL framework models multi-order fulfillment as a linear programming problem:

\[
\text{Minimize: } \langle C, X \rangle
\]
Subject to:
- Equality constraints \( A'X = b' \)
- Inequality constraints \( E'X \leq d \)
- Feasibility \( 0 \leq X \leq 1 \)

### **Complexity Analysis**
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(J \cdot |Q| \cdot (|M|)^{3.5} \cdot L) \), where \( J \) is the number of iterations.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(N + |A| + |E| + |b| + |d|) \).

### **Key Algorithms**
- **Complete Decomposition Method**: For fully separable problems.
- **Arbitrary Decomposition Method**: Balances time and space complexities dynamically.

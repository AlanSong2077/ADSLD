# **ADSLD: A General Framework for Solving Large-Scale Linear Programming Problems in Multi-Order Fulfillment Scenarios**

Welcome to the **ADSLD** repository! This project introduces a groundbreaking framework for efficiently solving large-scale linear programming problems in multi-order fulfillment scenarios, leveraging **Lagrangian Relaxation**, **duality principles**, and **arbitrary decomposition**.

---

## üìò **Overview**

This repository provides an implementation of the **Arbitrary Decomposition Supergradient Method Based on Lagrangian Relaxation and Duality (ADSLD)**. With the rapid growth of e-commerce, businesses face unprecedented challenges in processing millions of orders daily while managing fulfillment for diverse products efficiently.

**ADSLD Framework Highlights**:
- Decomposes complex optimization problems into manageable subproblems.
- Efficiently utilizes computational resources through decomposition and duality.
- Scales seamlessly to meet the demands of large-scale operations.
- Generalizes existing methods (e.g., CDSL), enabling enhanced performance.

### **Why Use ADSLD?**
The framework is specifically designed to overcome the limitations of traditional optimization methods in dynamic, large-scale fulfillment scenarios by:
1. Reducing computational complexity.
2. Dynamically adapting to real-world constraints.
3. Supporting batch processing for efficient parallelization.

## üîß **Code Description**

The code implementation is modular, making it easy to adapt or extend. Below are the primary components:

### **1. Random Data Initialization**
Simulates realistic fulfillment scenarios with:
- Randomized cost vectors, constraints, and matrices.
- Flexible configurations for problem scale (number of items, methods, facilities, etc.).

### **2. Lagrangian Relaxation Problem Definition**
Uses the **CPLEX solver** and **Pulp library** for linear programming:
- Models the primary objective function (e.g., minimizing costs).
- Defines constraints (e.g., inventory, order fulfillment).

### **3. Supergradient Optimization**
Iteratively updates Lagrangian multipliers to:
- Handle relaxed constraints.
- Improve solution feasibility and quality.

### **4. Performance Evaluation**
Assesses:
- Convergence behavior.
- Solution quality (objective value).
- Scalability (execution time and resource usage).

## üìä **Theoretical Insights**

### **Optimization Model**
The core problem is modeled as a linear program:
\[
\text{Minimize: } \langle C, X \rangle
\]
Subject to:
1. **Order Constraints**: \( A'X = b' \)  
2. **Inventory Constraints**: \( E'X \leq d \)  
3. **Feasibility**: \( 0 \leq X \leq 1 \)

### **Complexity Analysis**
- **Time Complexity**:  
  \( O(J \cdot |Q| \cdot (|M|)^{3.5} \cdot L) \)  
- **Space Complexity**:  
  \( O(N + |A| + |E| + |b| + |d|) \)  

### **Convergence and Scalability**
1. **Convergence**: Achieved through iterative multiplier updates.  
2. **Scalability**: Designed to handle up to tens of millions of variables efficiently.
